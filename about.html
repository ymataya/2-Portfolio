                Hi, I'm Yna (pronounced 'Ee-na').<br>
                I'm a designer and web developer who is passionate in learning,  is a patient problem-solver, and values creating meaningful projects. 
                I would say I'm an interdisciplinary artist since I love branching out of graphic design and learning
                different mediums to showcase my work. I believe that art is reinvention. My designs are products of a process of recreation and patience that I hone each day. 
                Whenever I create something, I aim to incorporate not just aesthetics, but meaning as well, in hopes of conveying the message that are well-built, clear, and impactful. 
                Looking forward to hone my skills more in the future as part of a collaborative team in the industry.
            </p>
            <hr class="my-5">
            <!-- <p>If you would like to know more about me, please feel free to contact me. I would also love to hear any
                feedback on my work. Thank you!</p> -->
